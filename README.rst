Selenic is a collection of Python code which is used for testing
browser-based software through Selenium. It is tailored for the
projects at Mangalam Research.

If you want to run tests in Chrome, you only need
chromedriver. Chromedriver is `here
<https://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/downloads/list>`__. The
documentation for its use is `here
<http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver>`__.

Please look at the examples in `<examples>`_ and read the source code
to know how this all works.
